0x0C. Web server
In this project, I learned how web servers work and began using one. I was provided a personal server by Holberton School. I learned how to use scp and Fabric to transfer files to my server. Additionally, I completed a basic configuration of the server using Nginx.

Tasks
Transfer a file to your server 0-transfer_file: Bash script that transfers a file from Holberton's client to a server. Accepts four arguments: • The path of the file to be transferred. • The IP of the server to transfer the file to. • The username that scp connects with. • The path of the SSH private key that scp uses. scp transfers the file to the user home directory ~/.
